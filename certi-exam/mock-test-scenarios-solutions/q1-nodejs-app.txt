I. Deploy https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex on openshift in q1 namespace/project


 steps: 
  1. minishift should be preinstalled with oc client on local machine if you dont have oc client installed on local machine 
  
  2. Run eval $(minishift oc-env) will make use of oc of minishift in that particular session alone
  
  3. Run minishift start 

  4. you should see The server is accessible via web console at:
    https://192.168.42.239:8443/console
  
  5. login as developer user 
  6. oc login -u developer -p pass https://192.168.42.239:8443

  7. oc whoami (To Check user you have logged in)
  8. create new project q1
     

     1. oc new-project q1 \
    --display-name="q1" --description="Sample Node.js app"


     2. oc project q1(to go to project q1 will be done by default no need to run this expecitly)


     3. oc new-app --name nodeapp --strategy source --code https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex 
     
            or 
        oc new-app --strategy source --cdoe https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex -l name=nodepp

     4. check oc status on resources status 
     check for is, bc, dc, pods, services(svc)
    
     5. now expose svc as route (will create route to access the service outside of cluster)

        1. oc expose svc/nodeapp 

          will create a default route (http://nodeapp-q1.192.168.42.239.nip.io )

          http://<app_name>-<namespace>.<minishift-ip>.npi.io

          by this you can able to access svc ouside the cluster 
          
        2. oc expose svc/nodeapp --hostname nodeapp.lab.example.com
          
           will create route but to access this particular route outside cluster DNS Resolution need to be done locally to forward the traffic to            respective svc
  
           open terminal vi /etc/hosts
           add <minishift-ip>  <hostname>
                192.168.42.239  nodeapp.lab.example.com

        3. now open firefox and provide hostname of your application which can be accesseable
