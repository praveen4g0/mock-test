making use of nodeapp dc which was deployed earlier




now exposing svc as nodeport insted of clusterip


if we expose svc as nodeport that can be accessable directly outside the cluster from nodeport with ip address as minishift ip



providing resource yaml file of service 


apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nodeapp
  name: nodeapp-1
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      nodePort: 30036
      name: http
  selector:
    app: nodeapp
    deploymentconfig: nodeapp
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: NodePort

difference between cluster and nodeport


clusterip type can be accessable only inside cluster you can test service by doing ssh into minishift cluster and do curl http://localhost:8080/

as you are inside cluster you can access the svc/pod on targetport(8080) which will point to  port (8080) application



now with nodepport we are saying service to expose pod to outer world on port 30036(NodePort)  which will point to port(8080) of application


oc project q2

oc create -f ./path-to-NodePort-svc-yaml


oc get svc

[root@localhost artifacts]# oc get svc
NAME                       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
nodeapp                    ClusterIP   172.30.75.227   <none>        8080/TCP         21h
nodeapp-1                  NodePort    172.30.217.46   <none>        8080:30036/TCP   20h
 

now access application which is exposed to outerworld on port 30036

using minishift ip


minishift ip

[root@localhost artifacts]# minishift ip
192.168.42.239



now open firefox http://192.168.42.239:30036


you can access nodeapp application without route
