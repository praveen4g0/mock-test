Write a job which can runs 4 pods in parallel (logic of your choice)


Need to create A resource of kind job and spec.parallelism value as 4 to run 4 containers at the same time


yaml file with basic logic of printing name at run time and sleep for 10 seconds

apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: job-parallel
spec:
  parallelism: 4
  template:
    metadata:
      name: job-prallel
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        command: [ '/bin/sh' ]
        args: ["-c","while true; do echo 'praveen'; sleep 10; done"]
      restartPolicy: OnFailure






save this yaml file as parallel-job.yaml

now under any project 

1. oc create -f ./path-to/parallel-job.yaml


   job.batch/job-parallel created


2. oc get jobs
   
   [root@localhost artifacts]# oc get jobs
	NAME           DESIRED   SUCCESSFUL   AGE
	job-parallel   <none>    0            6m

3. oc get pods
   [root@localhost artifacts]# oc get pods
	NAME                               READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
	cakephp-mysql-persistent-1-build   0/1       Error              0          5h
	dapi-test-pod                      0/1       Completed          0          20h
	job-parallel-jlm47                 1/1       Running            0          6m
	job-parallel-nzppd                 1/1       Running            0          6m
	job-parallel-qbcn2                 1/1       Running            0          6m
	job-parallel-zj8nz                 1/1       Running            0          6m

4. now check logs of running pods

    
	1. oc logs -f job-parallel-jlm47
 
     [root@localhost artifacts]# oc logs -f job-parallel-jlm47
	praveen
	praveen
	praveen	
	praveen
       
      2.  1. oc logs -f job-parallel-nzppd
 
     [root@localhost artifacts]# oc logs -f job-parallel-nzppd
        praveen
        praveen
        praveen
        praveen
